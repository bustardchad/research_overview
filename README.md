# research_overview

This repo contains some example Python and C++ scripts I've created over the years in support of my galaxy evolution research. Each folder corresponds to a different project, with a link to relevant publications included for each one. Each folder also contains a Jupyter notebook that describes the project in layman's terms and performs some analysis on a data product. 

Directory organization:

  LMC_Analysis_Examples -- project where I simulated supernova-driven outflows of gas from the Large Magellanic Cloud, a dwarf satellite galaxy currently infalling through the halo of the Milky Way. The main publication is Bustard et al. 2020, ApJ, but the analysis performed in this directory has also been used in additional collaborative projects.
  
  CR_Turb_Examples -- project where I simulated how normal thermal gas, magnetic fields, and relativistic cosmic rays interact in idealized, turbulent environments. Analylsis of the resulting simulation suite has so far resulted in two publications (Bustard and Oh 2022, 2023)
